  <description>
    Sets up a high level nodelet controller for p0, with amplification built into a composite open loop plant signal for which the zero dynamics is the desired amplification behavior. The controller includes a dynamic lag compensator for this open loop signal boosts low frequency gain and sets up a more predictable low frequency crossover point. Note that, since this controller does not include a disturbance observer, it must be robust to changing human impedance, and this is achieved heuristically.
